This project is a work in progress that has the aim to create an easy way to
generate 3D frame models for printing purposes. In the very first released
version 0.0.2 it is possible to generate variable sized ractangles, with fixed
positioned holes to mount one to another. The fixed position means the holes
are always at the same distance from each other, based on the hole size
(different hole sizes would not work together).

Until version 0.0.2 the code is mainly tested with a hole size of 3 mm. Other
sizes do work as well, but since it is not intensively tested you might run
into issues (which I would like to know ofcourse!).
