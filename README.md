# uniframe

This project is a work in progress that has the aim to create an easy way to
generate 3D frame models for printing purposes. In the very first released
version 0.0.2 it is possible to generate variable sized rectangles, with fixed
positioned holes to mount one to another. The fixed position means the holes
are always at the same distance from each other, based on the hole size
(different hole sizes would not work together).

Until version 0.0.2 the code is mainly tested with a hole size of 3 mm. Other
sizes do work as well, but since it is not intensively tested you might run
into issues (which I would like to know ofcourse!).

# This version
This version (0.x.x) is basically a beta version. Features may be changed often
and may change without any compatibility from one version to another. Although,
I'll do my best to avoid any issues of this kind. Any known compatibility
issues will be mentiones in the README file or version specific release notes.

# Future development
As said in the into of this file, uniframe is a work in progress. Where the
main and only option now is to create rectangle shapes, I would like to
develop different shapes and options, such as:
- circle shapes
- triangle shapes
- diagonal bars

...and hopefully a lot more.

At this moment I develop what I need or what I would like to try out. Feel free
to come up with suggestions or better, code! I do not have any roadmap for what
I am going to develop, at least not yet. If you have any ideas, you can create
an issue for it.
